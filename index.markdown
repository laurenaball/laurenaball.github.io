I work to strengthen communities using math, science and technology. I believe creating strong and healthy communities is the best way to create a better future for sentient life on earth.

I am driven by <br>
  1) curiosity and the beauty of truth <br>
  2) a duty to minimize suffering and contribute to human knowledge. 

I am from Atlanta, Georgia. I was a first generation college student and the first in my extended family to earn a graduate degree.
