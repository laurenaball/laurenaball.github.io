I work to strengthen communities using science and technology. Math enables us to understand and make use of science and technology in order to create a better future for sentient life on earth.

I am a first-generation college student from Atlanta, Georgia. 

I am driven by 
  1) curiosity and the beauty of truth
  2) belief in a duty to help further human understanding and minimize suffering for sentient life on earth.
